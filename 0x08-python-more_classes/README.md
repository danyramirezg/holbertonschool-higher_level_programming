# Python - More Classes and Objects

Resources:

-Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
-Object-Oriented Programming (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
-Class and Instance Attributes
-classmethods and staticmethods [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8cL2XMM5M]
-Properties vs. Getters and Setters (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”) [https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php]
-str vs repr [https://brennerm.github.io/posts/python-str-vs-repr.html]
